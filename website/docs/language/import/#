  Import resources into Terraform to bring them under Terraform's management by writing `import` blocks in code.

# Import

-> **Note:** Import blocks are only available in Terraform v1.5.0 and later.

~> **Experimental:** Import blocks are an experimental Terraform feature. While we do not expect to make backwards-incompatible changes to their syntax, processing of imports during the plan, generating configuration, and the `-generate-config-out` flag may change in future releases.


Terraform can import existing infrastructure resources, which brings them under Terraform's management. Once you have imported a resource, it will be present in the Terraform configuration and state, just like a resource you had created via Terraform. You can then manage it like any other resource, updating its attributes and destroying it as part of a normal resource lifecycle.
An `import` block records that Terraform imported the resource, that it was not originally created due to this Terraform configuration. Considered another way, it records the user's intent that an import be added to Terraform's plan graph.

## `import` block syntax

The `import` block can appear in any Terraform configuration file. A common pattern is to create an `imports.tf` file, or to place each `import` block next to the `resource` block it will import into.

```hcl
import {
  to = aws_instance.example
  id = "i-abcd1234"
}
```

The above `import` block defines an import of the AWS instance with ID "i-abcd1234" into the resource address `aws_instance.example` in the root module.

The `import` block has the following arguments:
 - `to` - The resource instance address targeted by this import.
 - `id` - The import ID of the resource. String.
 - `provider` (optional) - A custom resource provider. See [The Resource provider Meta-Argument](link).


## Planning and applying an import

The `import` block, like all Terraform configuration blocks, is processed during the `terraform plan` operation, which outputs a list of changes Terraform will make if you choose to apply. Along with create, update, remove, and move, import is an action Terraform can perform on a resource. The resource is only added to the state during `terraform apply`.

### 1. Add the `import` block to configuration


### 2. Add the `resource` block to configuration


### 3. Plan the import
Run `terraform plan`. You should see output like the following:


### 4. Apply the import
Run `terraform apply`. You should see output like the following:



## Resource configuration

When Terraform imports a resource, it needs the resource to be defined in configuration before saving it to the state. This means that when using `import` blocks, you have two options.

### Option: Write a `resource` block

Write a `resource` block for the resource you are importing, whose address matches the import block target. For example:

```hcl
import {
  to = aws_instance.example
  id = "i-abcd1234"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  name = "renderer"
}
```

### Option: Generate configuration

Terraform can generate HCL for resources which do not already exist in configuration. The HCL produced by Terraform is intended to act as a template, and contains Terraform's best guess at the appropriate value for each resource argument. You may find that you arrive at an ideal configuration by starting from the HCL generated by Terraform, removing some attributes, adjusting the value of others, and rearranging `resource` blocks into files and modules as appropriate.

To instruct Terraform to generate configuration during the plan, supply a file path with `-generate-config-out`. The file should not already exist. For example:

```
terraform plan -generate-config-out=generated_resources.tf
```

Terraform will generate configuration for any resources targeted by an `import` block that do not already exist in configuration, and write the HCL to `generated_resources.tf`.

Please see the page Working With Generated Configuration for more details on config generation.


## Examples

### Import into module

```hcl
import {
  to = module.instances.aws_instance.example
  id = "i-abcd1234"
}
```

### Import into resource configured with `count`

```hcl
import {
  to = aws_instance.example[0]
  id = "i-abcd1234"
}
```


### Import into resource configured with `for_each`
```hcl
import {
  to = aws_instance.example["foo"]
  id = "i-abcd1234"
}
```

### Import with custom resource provider

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  alias = "europe"
  region = "eu-west-1"
}

import {
  provider = aws.europe
  to = aws_instance.example["foo"]
  id = "i-abcd1234"
}
```
